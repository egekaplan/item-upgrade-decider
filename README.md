# itemUpgradeDecider
This project allows the user to decide whether to take a risk while playing an online game with item upgrading factor. It takes two inputs from the user. The first input is the desired item level (+?) and the second input is the unit price of the item (can bought via NPC's or just an average market price) while it is only (+1). The code calculates the expected amount of items to have in order to successfully upgrade an item from +1 to (+user input) using the geometric distribution. The "Upgrading Costs" are added to totalCost (eg. 25K 35K 75K 240K 240K 750K 1M relatively from +2 to +8)

Used Swing as the built-in GUI toolkit.
