  <h1>MMORPG Item Upgrading Application</h1>
  <p>This application supports in the decision-making process for an online gamer who is playing an MMORPG with an item upgrading factor. The user provides two inputs. The desired item level (<span style="font-weight: bold;">+</span>?) is the initial input, followed by the item's unit price (<span style="font-weight: bold;">+1</span>), which can be obtained from NPCs or simply by purchasing off the market. The geometric distribution is used to determine how many items are necessary to successfully upgrade an item from <span style="font-weight: bold;">+1</span> to (<span style="font-weight: bold;">+user input</span>). The "Upgrading Trial Costs" are also computed in terms of Expected Total Cost (for example, 25K, 35K, 75K, 240K, 750K, and 1M, respectively, from <span style="font-weight: bold;">+2</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold;">+8</span>).</p>
  <p>Used Swing as the built-in GUI toolkit.</p>
