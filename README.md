# itemUpgradeDecider
This application supports in the decision-making process for an online gamer who is playing an MMORPG with item upgrading factor. The user provides two inputs. The desired item level (+?) is the initial input, followed by the item's unit price (+1), which can be obtained from NPCs or simply by purchasing off the market. The geometric distribution is used to determine how many items are necessary to successfully upgrade an item from +1 to (+user input). The "Upgrading Trial Costs" are also computed in terms of Expected Total Cost (for example, 25K, 35K, 75K, 240K, 750K, and 1M, respectively, from +2 to +8).

Used Swing as the built-in GUI toolkit.
